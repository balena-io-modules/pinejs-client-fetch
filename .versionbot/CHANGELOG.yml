                When resolving the typings of a query, if the id is not present
                and we try to access it anyway

                typescript will infer `unknown`, which caused
                `OptionsToResponse` to satisfy as if ID was present (thus,
                turning it into a query with `id`)

              hash: 1077e19ef18cc4cede4d6401496a016fef459150
              body: >
                This requires passing the model typings when creating the
                pinejs-client

                instance and will mean that any usage after that will be type
                checked

                to limit to resources/properties that exist on the model. This
                covers

                almost all usage but there are some cases we cannot cover as we
                would

                need typescript support for partial inference of generics, eg
                for

                lambdas, or to make major changes to the querying interface.

                This work should also be fully backwards compatible such that if
                you do

                not provide model typings then all typings should continue to
                work as

                previously

              hash: 5ad1d4a417e2631d70acf7192b7132366a77be3b

                The intention is that these are use as helpers functions to
                build the

                url from an object and so passing a `url` directly is not really
                the

                intent and interferes with improving the typings for the
                intended case.

                It is still possible to pass urls directly to the `request`
                function if

                it is essential but the true answer is to support building those
                urls,

                and using `prepare` if it is necessary

                This is because they are not designed to support using a `url`
                and are

                likely to break in very weird and unexpected ways, and as such
                removing

                it from the typing should reduce potential for surprising errors
